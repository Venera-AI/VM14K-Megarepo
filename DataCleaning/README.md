# Data Cleaning Scripts

This folder contains scripts used in the data cleaning process for question-answer datasets.

## Contents

- **`classification.py`**  
  Utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to clean and standardize the dataset. This includes:
  - Removing unwanted elements such as HTML tags, index markers, etc.
  - Reformatting questions and answers for consistency.

- **`final_transform.ipynb`**  
  Shuffles the cleaned data generated by the classification script. This prepares the dataset for evaluation across different models.

## Usage

1. Run `classification.py` to preprocess and clean your raw dataset.
## Notes

- Ensure your environment has access to the required LLM APIs or models before running `classification.py`.
- These scripts are intended to streamline preprocessing for downstream tasks such as model benchmarking or training.
